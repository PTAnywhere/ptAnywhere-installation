# PTAnywhere installation

PTAnywhere installation script for a Linux distribution using Ansible (and optionally Vagrant).

## Usage

Please go to [project wiki](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-installation/wiki/) to find extensive documentation on how to use these installation scripts:

 * [Requisites](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-installation/wiki/Requirements)
 * [How does a typical PTAnywhere installation look like?](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-installation/wiki/Typical-PTAnywhere-installation)
 * [Preparing the PT installation](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-installation/wiki/Preparing-the-PT-installation)
 * [Install PTAnywhere in any machine](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-installation/wiki/Install-PTAnywhere-using-Ansible) (using Ansible)
 * [Install PTAnywhere in predefined local Virtual Machines](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-installation/wiki/Install-PTAnywhere-using-Vagrant) (using Vagrant)


## Troubleshooting

 * Ansible throws an error which says: ```Missing become password```.
  * What happens? The remote user you are running needs to introduce a password to become sudo.
  * Quick solution: Add the ```--ask-become-pass``` parameter.
 * The Docker image cannot been built correctly the first time you run the Ansible script: ```dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: permission denied ```
  * What happens? The SSH connection used by Ansible does not know that the user is now part of the _docker_ group (because it has join the group within the same session). This problem is explained in more detail [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26677064/create-and-use-group-without-restart) (BTW, the solution described there does not work for me).
  * Quick solution: run the Ansible script (or the Vagrant one which uses it) a second time.
 * The PT instance gets stuck in a machine running behind a HTTP proxy and logs don't show any meaningul information.
  * Strange as it may sound, you might want to [unset the proxy for PacketTracer](https://github.com/PTAnywhere/ptAnywhere-installation/commit/b7518b994264c0516e540e21261e96cf6bc77318).
